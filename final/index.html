        <h3>Current State Intro:</h3>
        <p>In its current state my personal website has a tile navigation system on the creations page. This tile system allows the user to click a project tile and be brought to the project information on the same page. The microinteraction i am proposing would allow the user to hover over the project tile and they will see a short preview of the description on the back of the tile after a card flip animation.</p>
        <h3>Current State Images:</h3>
        <img src='images/current_tile.png' class="resize">


        <h3>Triggers:</h3>
        <p>Upon mouse hover over a tile the microinteraction is triggered. When the mouse stops hovering the microinteraction stops getting triggered.</p>

        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <p> When mouse hovers the front of the tile (displaying a thumbnail image and title) flips to the back and the back of the tile (displaying a description) flips to the front. When the back of the card's content appears it is covering the front of the tiles content and the same in reverse. </p>

        <h3>Feedback:</h3>
        <p>The user upon hovering over a tile sees the flip animation which shows the front information of the tile flip over to reveal the back information of the tile. The user goes from seeing an image and title to the description of the project all while hovering.</p>

        <h3>Loops and Modes:</h3>
        <p>If the user hovers over a tile the description is set to appear over the title and image. The previous information that was displayed on top moves to the bottom and the information that was on the bottom gets moved to the top. While the user continues to hover the mode continues. While there is no hover the original data is displayed.</p>
